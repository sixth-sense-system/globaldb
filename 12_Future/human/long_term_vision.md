## Integrity & Audit Automation â€” FUT-IA-001

**Priority:** High
**Owner:** MasterControl / OpsLog
**Status:** Proposed

**Summary:**
Automate the logging and verification of SHA-256 manifest confirmations and other integrity checkpoints across ENERQIS_GlobalDB.

**Scope & Deliverables:**
- CI or scheduled script to capture and append confirmation events into a centralized JSON audit log.
- Standardized schema for audit entries (timestamp, operator, hash, notes).
- Retention policy and storage location defined under Governance.
- Runbook and monitoring procedures added to `13_OpsLog`.

**Dependencies:**
- `tools/ci` scripts for automation
- Governance/Compliance policies

**Next Milestones:**
- [ ] Design draft automation job (script or GitHub Action)
- [ ] Approve schema & retention policy
- [ ] Implement & test logging mechanism
- [ ] Document procedures in OpsLog runbooks
