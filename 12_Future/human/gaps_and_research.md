# Gaps and Research

## Purpose
Identify current gaps in ENERQIS systems, AI models, data coverage, and market understanding, while outlining research areas needed to address these gaps.

## Framework
1. **System Gaps**
   - Missing functionality in cBots, backtesting, or strategy deployment
   - Integration gaps between modules

2. **Data Gaps**
   - Markets or instruments with incomplete historical or live data
   - Data quality or normalization issues

3. **AI/Algorithm Gaps**
   - Unmodeled risk factors
   - Sub-optimal model coverage or inference pipelines

4. **Research Opportunities**
   - Theoretical gaps in market behavior understanding
   - Potential innovations for execution, risk management, or portfolio optimization

## Process
- Each identified gap logged in the Master Research Log
- Assign research lead, expected deliverables, and timeline


### Integrity & Audit Automation (Tracking ID: FUT-IA-001)

**Description:**
Automate the logging and verification of SHA-256 manifest confirmations and other integrity checkpoints across ENERQIS_GlobalDB. This includes generating standardized JSON audit entries (timestamp, operator, hash, notes) for each confirmation event and running periodic integrity checks.

**Rationale:**
Ensures tamper-evidence, traceability, and compliance at scale without manual steps. Supports enterprise-grade auditability of all module manifests and project manifests.

**Next Steps:**
- Design an automated job (CI or scheduled script) to capture confirmations.
- Define the storage location and retention policy for these audit logs.
- When approved, migrate implementation details into `13_OpsLog` (procedures/runbooks) and `tools/ci` (scripts) and update governance docs accordingly.
