Change Log
- 2025-09-12 — Initialized by EREP v2.3 scaffold.

This document should summarize responsibilities, inputs, outputs, and operational assumptions. Include references to acceptance gates, data or code locations, and any external dependencies. When procedures evolve, update this file in the same pull request as the change. Avoid ambiguous language and include examples. This scaffold exists to pass governance gates and to provide a stable home for module knowledge.
