### ENERQIS Governance Update — Human File Presentation Protocol (HFPP) v1.0

**Purpose:**
To ensure strict, auditable, and reproducible handling of human file content across all ENERQIS modules, enforce the separation between human and machine artifacts, and formalize the procedural steps that have been iteratively refined.

---

#### 1. **Human File Presentation & Verification**

* **Rule HFPP-1:** All human file content must be presented **exactly verbatim** when being reviewed or verified, without truncation, paraphrasing, or summarization.
* **Rule HFPP-2:** Presentation of human file content must be in the **JSON chunk format**:

```json
{
  "module": "<Module_Name>",
  "phase": "<Phase_Number>",
  "chunk": <Chunk_Number>,
  "files": [
    {
      "type": "human",
      "name": "<human_file_name.md>",
      "content": "<full_verbatim_content_here>"
    }
  ]
}
```

* **Rule HFPP-3:** Each chunk may include multiple human files; each must be fully included and clearly named.

---

#### 2. **Machine Artifact Generation**

* **Rule HFPP-4:** Machine files do **not automatically mirror human file names or content**, except where explicitly required for traceability, audit, or compliance purposes (e.g., Governance Module 02).
* **Rule HFPP-5:** Before any machine artifact generation, confirmation of the **verbatim human files** must be completed. No machine files may be generated without this step.

---

#### 3. **Exceptions & Special Cases**

* **Rule HFPP-6:** Governance Module (Module 02) machine files **must** have exact human file names and verbatim content in JSON.
* **Rule HFPP-7:** Other modules’ machine files (e.g., Data, Infrastructure, AI/Algo) follow enterprise conventions: some machine files are manifests, workflow configs, logs, or operational artifacts and may not reflect exact human content.

---

#### 4. **Protocol Enforcement Workflow**

1. **Human File Submission:** Operator presents human files to governance or system reviewer in the JSON chunk format.
2. **Confirmation Step:** Reviewer confirms exact verbatim content before proceeding.
3. **Machine Artifact Generation:** System generates machine files only **after confirmation**, respecting exception rules (HFPP-6, HFPP-7).
4. **Logging & Traceability:** All confirmation events, machine file generation, and drift detection must be logged in Ops/Log (Module 13).
5. **Drift/Deviation Handling:** Any deviation triggers **immediate halt** and rollback to last canonical baseline.

---

#### 5. **Governance Implications**

* Formalizes the iterative learnings from Modules 01–04 to ensure **repeatable, auditable workflows**.
* Ensures clarity around when human content is mirrored verbatim and when machine files serve operational purposes.
* Codifies the JSON chunk format as the **standard presentation protocol** for all human file review.

---

#### 6. **Next Steps**

* Add this protocol as `human_file_presentation_policy.md` to **Module 02\_Governance**.
* Link it in `governance_index.md` for canonical reference.
* Update all operators and automation workflows to enforce **HFPP v1.0** before any machine artifact generation.
