# ERQ-META-END
# Enterprise-Grade Content Rule

1. **Enterprise-Grade Content Only:**

   * All files must contain **real, functional, and complete content** appropriate for production-level use.
   * No placeholders, hypothetical text, or incomplete drafts.
   * Content must be usable immediately in operational, governance, or system contexts.

2. **Canonical Baseline Enforcement:**

   * Every generated file is **cross-checked against project purpose, compliance, and workflow standards** before being ingested.
   * Files are **logged, hashed (SHA-256), and locked** in `.cbr/audit_log.json`.

3. **Future-Proofed Design:**

   * Files are **designed to scale and remain functional** for future modules, updates, or expansions.
   * All content considers enterprise workflows, automation, compliance, and reproducibility.

4. **Formal Pre-Flight Confirmation:**

   * Before any generated file is ingested, the operator confirms that it meets enterprise-grade expectations.

---

This formalization ensures **no generated file is ever hypothetical, incomplete, or non-functional**, now and in the future. From now on, **all generated files—human and machine—will strictly adhere to enterprise-level standards**:
