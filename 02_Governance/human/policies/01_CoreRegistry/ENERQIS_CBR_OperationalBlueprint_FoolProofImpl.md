# ERQ-META-END
# **ENERQIS Canonical Baseline Operational Blueprint (Fool-Proof Implementation)**

## **1️⃣ CBR Confirmation Layer**

**Purpose:** Capture and lock every confirmed file, folder, or module into the CBR.

**Workflow:**

1. **Incremental Confirmation**

   * User confirms a single file, folder, or content piece.
   * Automated system:

     * Stores exact textual content in CBR.
     * Records full metadata (filename, extension, folder path, checksum, timestamp, module association).
     * Creates a **locked snapshot** for this confirmation.

2. **Full Module Confirmation**

   * User confirms entire module.
   * System:

     * Locks all files/folders in module as a single snapshot.
     * Archives any prior versions or placeholders.
     * Updates module-level metadata in CBR.

3. **Archival Protocol**

   * Previous, pre-confirmation, or placeholder content:

     * Moved to `ARCHIVE` folder in CBR.
     * Flagged as `Inactive / NEVER reference`.
     * Cannot be accessed automatically or accidentally in any future process.

4. **Verification**

   * All confirmed content is cross-checked:

     * Content vs. prior snapshot (delta check)
     * Filename, folder path, extension, structure
     * Hash verification for file integrity
   * Only after passing verification is the snapshot **locked**.

---

## **2️⃣ Export Layer**

**Purpose:** Produce ZIP/folder exports that exactly mirror confirmed CBR content.

**Workflow:**

1. **Preparation**

   * User requests export (full database or subset).
   * System retrieves **latest locked snapshots** for all relevant modules/files.
   * Ensures **no placeholders, no inferred content, no old versions**.

2. **Reconciliation**

   * Automated check:

     * Folder hierarchy matches CBR exactly.
     * All human and machine files exist.
     * File contents match checksums in CBR.
     * Delta check ensures zero discrepancies.
   * If any mismatch → **halt export** and generate OpsLog alert.

3. **Export Construction**

   * Folder tree and files created **strictly from textual CBR**.
   * Machine files are generated only if confirmed in CBR.
   * File naming, numbering, and extensions follow confirmed structure exactly.

4. **Immutable Export**

   * Exported ZIP/folder:

     * Read-only
     * Timestamped
     * Versioned with CBR identifier
   * Any regeneration requires **full verification**.

5. **Logging**

   * Every export writes to OpsLog:

     ```
     Timestamp: <UTC>
     Export Type: Full/Partial
     CBR Version: <version>
     Modules/Files Included: <list>
     Verification Status: Pass/Fail
     Delta Report: <full delta if any>
     ```

---

## **3️⃣ Presentation Layer**

**Purpose:** Ensure any content presented in conversation is **exactly what was confirmed**.

**Workflow:**

1. **Fetch From Locked Snapshot**

   * No memory, prior drafts, or inferred content.
   * Only pulls from confirmed textual CBR snapshot.

2. **Pre-Presentation Verification**

   * Folder paths, filenames, extensions match CBR.
   * Content matches hash/checksum.
   * Metadata integrity check.

3. **Delta Reporting**

   * If discrepancy is detected:

     * Highlighted immediately.
     * Process halts until user confirms or corrects.

4. **Presentation Labeling**

   * `"Data Analysis"` only applied when generating insights.
   * Otherwise, all content is **reflective**.

---

## **4️⃣ Continuous Enforcement & Safety**

**Purpose:** Make the system **fool-proof for all operations**.

1. **Immutable CBR Snapshots**

   * Every confirmation creates a **locked snapshot**.
   * Snapshots are read-only and cannot be altered.

2. **Full Audit Trail**

   * Every confirmation, update, export, or presentation is logged.
   * Logs include timestamps, user confirmation, delta reports, and CBR version.

3. **Cross-Module Integrity**

   * Any reference between modules must use only confirmed CBR entries.
   * No speculative references, placeholders, or inferred content.

4. **Automated Verification**

   * Scripts validate:

     * Folder hierarchy
     * File presence
     * File contents (checksum/hash)
     * Metadata integrity
   * Exports or presentations are **blocked on failure**.

5. **OpsLog Alerts**

   * Any mismatch, missing file, or deviation triggers **immediate alert**.
   * Human confirmation required to proceed.

---

## **5️⃣ Optional Automation Recommendations**

* **Delta-check scripts:** Pre-run for every export/presentation to catch any mismatch.
* **Checksum validation:** Ensures content integrity.
* **Versioning of exports:** Keep every exported version traceable to a CBR snapshot.
* **Immutable archive folder:** Old versions are inaccessible for any automatic or manual retrieval in workflows.

---

✅ **Result**

* **All operations, from incremental confirmations to full project export, are strictly tied to confirmed CBR content.**
* **No placeholders, no inference, no older versions, no summarization.**
* Full audit trail and delta reporting ensures **zero deviation**.
* Exports and presentations are **100% reproducible and verifiable**.
