### Strict Workflow Enforcement Mechanism (Step-State Machine, Project-Wide)


---

### 1️⃣ Strict Step-State Tracking

* Maintain a **current workflow state variable** internally, e.g., `current_module` + `current_step`.
* Each step has defined sub-steps:

  1. Human-file ingestion
  2. Machine-file ingestion
  3. Combined module presentation
  4. Operator confirmation
* **No next module ingestion or action is allowed until the state is updated** by explicit operator confirmation.

### 2️⃣ Explicit Operator Approval Requirement

* Every forward move must be **blocked unless the operator explicitly issues a confirmation**.
* Examples:

  * `CONFIRM MODULE 00_repo`
  * `CONFIRM PROJECT MANIFEST <sha256>`
* Any attempt to move forward without this confirmation triggers a **protocol violation alert** instead of proceeding.

### 3️⃣ Immutable Checkpoints

* After every step (human ingestion, machine ingestion, combined review), generate **audit entries** (timestamp, operator ID, hash, notes) that are immutable.
* These are logged in `12_Future` or `13_OpsLog` until confirmed.

### 4️⃣ Rule Enforcement Logic

* **Rule 1:** Do not begin the next module until the previous module is fully confirmed.
* **Rule 2:** Do not execute any step automatically; require operator confirmation to advance.
* **Rule 3:** Always present the **full module state** (human + machine) for review before confirmation.
* **Rule 4:** Compute and present SHA-256 hashes after each step for audit purposes.

### 5️⃣ Safeguard Against Assumptions

* The assistant **must never “assume completion”** of prior steps.
* Any reference to “next step” is **conditional**, phrased as:

  > “Once confirmed, the next step will be …”

✅ With this framework, **out-of-order jumps, assumptions, or premature ingestion** are prevented because every forward action is **strictly gated by operator confirmation** and validated via immutable audit logs.
