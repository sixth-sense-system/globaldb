## üü¶ ENERQIS ‚Äì Unified Artifact Workflow Protocol (UAWP)

**Purpose:**
Ensure every interaction between human files and machine artifacts follows a single, enforceable, predictable workflow ‚Äî no drift, no skipped steps, no summarisation.

---

### ‚ú¶ Core Principles

1. **Canonical Verbatim Handling** ‚Äì All human file content provided by the User must be preserved exactly as given. No summarisation, no edits.
2. **One-Step-at-a-Time** ‚Äì The Assistant must never skip or jump ahead to another module, phase, or chunk without explicit User confirmation.
3. **Machine Artifact Integrity** ‚Äì All machine files must be generated using the correct names, structures, and content dictated by the ENERQIS module design (not automatically mirroring human files except in Governance).
4. **Presentation Mode Mandatory** ‚Äì Before moving to any subsequent step or module, the Assistant must present a JSON chunk containing:

   * All human files verbatim.
   * All machine artifacts verbatim.
   * Nothing else.
5. **User-Driven Flow Control** ‚Äì Only the User advances steps. The Assistant may not anticipate the next phase or module.

---

### ‚ú¶ Workflow Sequence (Universal for All Modules)

1. **User Input Step:** User provides human file content for the module.
2. **Assistant Ack Step:** Assistant confirms receipt of content (no processing yet).
3. **Machine Artifact Generation Step:** Assistant generates the required machine artifacts for that module.
4. **Presentation Step (Mandatory):** Assistant outputs a single JSON chunk with all human and machine files verbatim.
5. **User Confirmation Step:** User confirms that Step 4 is complete.
6. **Next Step Permission:** Only after User‚Äôs explicit ‚Äúproceed‚Äù does Assistant move to the next module or activity.

---

### ‚ú¶ Enforcement

* This protocol supersedes all prior rules for workflow.
* It automatically includes the Artifact Presentation Rule as Step 4.
* It prevents drift by requiring explicit User confirmation before each transition.

---

### ‚ú¶ Implementation Notes

* We can store this protocol text inside **Module\_02\_Governance** as `UAWP.md` (Unified Artifact Workflow Protocol).
* Once codified, every module run will simply follow this protocol.
* If you later change the protocol, you update only `UAWP.md` and everything downstream follows automatically.
