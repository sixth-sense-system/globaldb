## üîí **Canonical Manifest Format Policy**

### 1. Scope

This addendum applies to every module manifest, registry, or snapshot generated inside ENERQIS\_GlobalDB.

### 2. Format

* **Canonical Manifest Format = Strict JSON.**
* Every module, section, and field must be represented as a valid JSON object or array.
* No markdown headings, no comments, no extraneous symbols outside JSON syntax.

### 3. Presentation

* Any time a manifest segment, module, or the full manifest is presented for review or confirmation, it must be output in **this exact JSON format**.
* If a human-readable view is desired, it can be generated separately as a secondary view ‚Äî but the canonical, locked version is always JSON.

### 4. Locking

* Only the strict JSON version will be hashed, stored, and treated as the ‚Äúsource of truth‚Äù for CSEP/CSEL.
* Once confirmed by you with the `CONFIRM MODULE <NN> <manifest-sha256>` phrase, that JSON snapshot is considered immutable.

### 5. Export

* The final export of ENERQIS\_GlobalDB (ZIP or JSON chunks) will be **the strict JSON manifests**.
* These can be re-uploaded to a new chat or environment and will be used verbatim without inference.

---

From this point forward, every manifest segment and the final combined manifest will follow **this strict JSON policy**.
