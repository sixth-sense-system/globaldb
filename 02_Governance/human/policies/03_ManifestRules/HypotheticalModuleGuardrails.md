## üîí **CSEP/CSEL / Canonical Manifest Update ‚Äì Hypothetical Module Guardrails**

### 1. Scope

This update governs **all actions related to module creation, updates, ingestion, and presentation** in ENERQIS\_GlobalDB. It applies to **all human and machine content** within Modules 00‚Äì13 and 99.

---

### 2. Absolute Source of Truth

* **The canonical manifest (strict JSON)**, once confirmed, is **immutable** and represents the only authoritative project structure.
* **No content, module, file, or folder** may exist or be referenced outside of what is defined in the canonical manifest **unless explicitly added via confirmed workflow**.

---

### 3. Pre-Flight Check

Before performing **any action on a module**, the following must occur:

1. Present the **locked structure** of the target module from the canonical manifest.
2. Require **operator confirmation** before any ingestion, editing, or creation.
3. No action may proceed unless **confirmation is explicitly received**.
4. **Display all folders, files, and subfolders** in strict JSON for verification.

---

### 4. Forbidden Actions (Hypothetical/Inferred Content)

* **No hypothetical modules or files:**
  Under no circumstances shall the system generate, draft, infer, or otherwise produce a module, folder, or file that is **not already part of the confirmed manifest**.
* **No placeholders or assumptions:**
  Anything that would serve as a placeholder or inferred content (e.g., `<future_module>`, `<template>`, or ‚Äúhypothetical‚Äù) is strictly forbidden.
* **Erasure prevention:**
  Any attempt to overwrite, replace, or ‚Äúredefine‚Äù an existing module outside the locked manifest must be blocked.

---

### 5. Module Creation / Updates

* Any new module, folder, or file must follow **this workflow**:

  1. **Proposal stage**: The operator specifies the intended addition in a locked proposal JSON object.
  2. **Verification stage**: The system validates against existing manifest‚Äîno conflicts allowed.
  3. **Confirmation stage**: Operator approves with `CONFIRM MODULE <NN> <hash>` style.
  4. **Locking stage**: Only after confirmation is the manifest updated, and a new SHA-256 computed.

---

### 6. Canonical Manifest Presentation

* Must always be in **strict JSON** format.
* Any visual or human-readable rendering is secondary and must **never** be used for ingestion or confirmation.
* Any display of a module must come directly from the **locked JSON** manifest.

---

### 7. Export / Backup

* Any export (ZIP, JSON chunks, snapshots) must be **directly derived from the locked manifest**.
* Any deviation (missing files, extra folders, or hypothetical content) is **rejected automatically**.

---

### 8. Audit / Logging

* Every action on modules, including pre-flight checks, edits, and exports, is **logged in `.cbr/audit_log.json`**.
* Attempted creation of hypothetical/inferred content triggers an **audit flag** and halts execution.
* The system must report any attempted deviation **before** proceeding.

---

### 9. Reinforcement Guardrails

* **Memory safety:**
  Do not rely on temporary memory or assumptions about the project. Every module/file reference must come from the **locked manifest**.
* **No drift:**
  Under no circumstances can content be generated ‚Äúfrom scratch‚Äù outside confirmed workflows.
* **CSEP/CSEL enforcement at all times:**
  Every operation, including future AI assistance or content generation, must **first verify against the manifest**.

---

‚úÖ **Result:**
This update guarantees that:

* Hypothetical modules cannot be created.
* The canonical manifest cannot be silently overwritten.
* Every module, folder, and file is explicitly checked and confirmed before any action.
* The JSON manifest remains the **single source of truth** at all times.
