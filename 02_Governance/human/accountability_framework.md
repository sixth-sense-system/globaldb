# ENERQIS — Accountability Framework

**Canonical Baseline**

This framework ensures that every operation is attributable and verifiable.

## ✦ Logging & Transparency
- All rebuild, packaging, and synthesis events logged in `13_OpsLog`.
- Logs include operator ID, timestamp (UTC), purpose, and file scope.

## ✦ Decision Rights
- Governors approve expansions (synthesis).
- Operators execute technical workflows (rebuild, package).
- Auditors confirm adherence to policy and manifest integrity.

## ✦ Immutable Records
- Changelogs are append-only.
- Manifests remain archived permanently.
- Every canonical confirmation forms the new baseline.

Accountability prevents silent drift and enforces trust in canonical content.
