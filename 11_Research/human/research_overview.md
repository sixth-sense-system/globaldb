# Research Overview

## Purpose
The Research module centralizes all investigative work, experimentation, and knowledge synthesis for ENERQIS. It ensures that new insights are captured, validated, and integrated into strategy, AI, and system development.

## Scope
- Market and strategy research
- Data analysis pipelines
- Experiment design and logging
- Reproducibility standards
- Integration with AI_Algo, System, and Data modules

## Objectives
1. Maintain a single source of truth for research findings
2. Standardize experiment recording and documentation
3. Support reproducibility and versioning
4. Bridge research insights into operational strategies
