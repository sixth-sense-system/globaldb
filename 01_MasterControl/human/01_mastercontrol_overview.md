## ✦ Mission & Objectives
ENERQIS is an enterprise-grade AI Trading Engine that blends robust, interpretable quantitative methods with selective machine intelligence to produce **consistent, risk-adjusted returns** while preserving **auditability, security, and operational discipline**.

**Core Objectives**
- **Consistency**: Minimize drawdowns; prioritize high risk-adjusted returns.
- **Rigor**: Time-series-aware validation (purged CV, walk-forward), reproducible pipelines, manifest-driven artifacts.
- **Security**: LLM safety, secrets management, strict provenance.
- **Velocity with Control**: Rapid iteration via prototypes → parity → production, always behind risk gates.
- **Human-in-Loop**: Advisory-mode ML/LLM with explicit operator approval for production changes.

**KPIs (initial)**
- Max Drawdown ≤ 15% (system-level), PF ≥ 1.4, Sharpe ≥ 1.2 on out-of-sample walk-forward.
- End-to-end reproducible backtest → package in ≤ 30 minutes.
- All trades traceable to versioned strategy + config + dataset hash.

---

## ✦ Purpose
The Master Control file acts as the **root control center** of the ENERQIS Global Database.
It integrates strategy, research, infrastructure, and operations into a unified architecture.
All other modules inherit structural guidance, formatting, and canonical rules from this file.

---

## ✦ Foundation, Architecture & Infrastructure
- **Layers**
  1. **Data**: ETL → Feature Store (Parquet/Arrow) → DVC-like dataset hashes.
  2. **Research**: Notebooks, prototypes, experiment tracking (MLflow-compatible).
  3. **Strategies**: cBots (C#) + Python parity + YAML strategy manifests.
  4. **Execution**: Paper/live trade adapters, slippage & latency models.
  5. **Governance & Audit**: Changelogs, append-only logs, packaging & handoff.

- **Key Services**
  - Grounding microservice for LLM signals (news/filings/prices) with provenance.
  - Security & red-team harness (prompt-injection/exfiltration checks).
  - Metrics & monitoring: data staleness, model latency, risk exposure.

## ✦ Terminology Database (selected)
- **Energy**: spectral intensity in target bands (CWT/Welch), used to gate breakout entries.
- **Grounded Sentiment**: LLM output with attached provenance (source IDs + timestamps).
- **Purged CV**: Cross-validation that removes leakage around splits to respect causality.
- **Parity**: Strategy logic equivalence across languages/platforms (Python ↔ cBot).

---

## ✦ News & Market Intelligence
- Curated streams: economic calendars, news headlines, SEC filings.
- Ingestion rules: timestamp alignment to UTC, dedupe, normalization, sparse storage of raw text, cached embeddings.
- Use: research dashboards, signal gating, risk alerts.

---

## ✦ Governance, Confidentiality & Safeguards
- **Access control**: secrets in vault; least-privilege; env var indirection.
- **LLM safety**: retrieval sanitization, red-team suites, context minimalism, rate limiting.
- **Packaging/Handoff**: see `packaging_policy.md` and `roadmap_blueprint.md` appendices.
