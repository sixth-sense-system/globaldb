# 03_Data — Data Layer Overview

**Purpose:**
The Data Layer of ENERQIS serves as the foundation for all quantitative, qualitative, and operational data. It ensures structured, validated, and traceable data flows into the feature store, research layer, and downstream modules.

## ✦ Core Principles
1. **Integrity First:** All data ingestions must pass validation, cleansing, and integrity checks before being stored.
2. **Traceability:** Each dataset is tracked with a deterministic hash and versioned.
3. **Modularity:** Data is structured into discrete pipelines for ingestion, normalization, and storage.
4. **Scalability:** Supports increasing volumes of market, research, and operational datasets.
5. **Interoperability:** Fully compatible with machine artifacts, analytics tools, and AI workflows.

## ✦ Data Flow Overview
1. **Ingestion:** Raw market, research, and operational data is pulled via automated pipelines.
2. **Normalization:** Data is standardized into canonical schemas, units, and timestamps.
3. **Storage:** Parquet/Arrow storage with DVC-like hash versioning ensures reproducibility.
4. **Access & Retrieval:** Authorized modules can retrieve data via APIs, feature stores, or query engines.

## ✦ Module Integration
- Supports Infrastructure (Module 04), Blueprint (Module 05), System (Module 06), AI/Algo (Module 10), and Research (Module 11) pipelines.
- Provides validation logs for Ops/Log (Module 13) review.
