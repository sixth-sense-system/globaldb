# Living Scorecard Sync Rules
- Backlog is canonical for content (What/Why/How/Tags/RICE).
- Scorecard is canonical for execution fields (owner/sprint/start/due/status/KPIs).
- Shared fields that may flow back to backlog: status, timeframe, when_start, due_date, priority (only via acceptance).
- IDs never change; MD renders are read-only.
