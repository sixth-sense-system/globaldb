# Innovation Dossier — Vision Pass

This dossier captures cross-domain ideas (markets + space weather + geometry + prediction markets) and converts them into backlog-ready units.
Each item has acceptance gates (PIT, leakage-safe eval) and points to execution paths (features, tests). See `13_OpsLog/TODO/enerqis_backlog.csv`.

- Energy strategies core (3 now, +3–6 follow-ons)
- LOB+CVD core for intraday order-flow
- Perps OI/Funding/Basis, liquidation density clusters
- Space weather (Kp/Ap/Bz/F10.7) nowcasting; EM/Schumann proxies (exploratory)
- ENSO/QBO/NAO teleconnections
- Gann ingestion + harmonics/geometry library (strict tests)
- Macro event engine; multi-timeframe alignment
- Execution policy map; Risk Brain v1
- Prediction-market parity daemon; resolution-source watcher
- Cashback/swap/fees PnL uplift; stage-1/2 platform roadmap
