# ENERQIS — Enterprise Baseline Governance & CSEP/CSEL Addendum

## Version: 2025-09-07 (Full Canonical, Project-Wide)

**Generated:** 2025-09-07 UTC

**Scope:** Comprehensive governance and operational standard for the entire ENERQIS ecosystem, modules 00 → 99, including human and machine files, CI/CD, OpsLog protocols, SHA‑256 verification, workflow enforcement, escalation procedures, and MasterControl oversight.

**Purpose:** Establish an unambiguous, fully operational, and auditable enterprise-standard protocol for the ENERQIS Global Database, ensuring all modules and processes are strictly controlled, sequential, and validated before progressing.

## 1. Canonical Baseline Definition & Enforcement

1.1 **Definition:** The canonical baseline is the last fully confirmed, audited, and SHA‑256–verified state of the entire ENERQIS Global Database, including all human and machine files.

1.2 **Enforcement Rules:**
* No deviation from the canonical baseline without explicit operator confirmation.
* All rebuilds, packaging, or synthesis operations reference the canonical baseline.
* Any addition, deletion, or modification triggers SHA‑256 verification, audit logging, and operator confirmation before locking a new baseline.
* Deviations are considered critical drift and escalate automatically to OpsLog review.

1.3 **Cross-Module Dependencies:**
* Any update to a module triggers automated cross-reference checks for all downstream dependencies.
* Inter-module references, imports, or manifests must remain consistent with the confirmed baseline.

---

## 2. Module Stepwise Confirmation Protocol

2.1 **Human File Ingestion:**
* Present all human files verbatim to the operator.
* Operator must confirm completeness and fidelity before proceeding.

2.2 **Machine File Generation:**
* Generate enterprise-standard machine files: `.gitignore`, `registry.json`, `audit_log.json`, and `manifest.json`.
* SHA‑256 hashes calculated for every file.
* Operator must confirm module hash before step closure.

2.3 **Step Closure:**
* Module considered complete only after human file confirmation, machine file confirmation, SHA‑256 verification, and OpsLog entry.
* No implicit closure or automation-driven advancement.

---

## 3. SHA‑256 Audit & Append-Only Logging

3.1 **Audit Schema:**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "<UTC_ISO8601>",
  "event": "<CONFIRM_PROJECT_MANIFEST|CONFIRM_MODULE_MANIFEST>",
  "module": "<module_name>",
  "operator": "<operator_id>",
  "project_manifest_hash": "<sha256>",
  "notes": "<description>"
}
```

3.2 **Mechanism:**
* All confirmations append to a central append-only JSON audit log (`13_OpsLog/ops_activity.log`).
* Audit logs immutable; append-only edits only create new entries.

3.3 **Verification:**
* Periodic automated verification of all SHA‑256 hashes across modules.
* Any mismatch triggers immediate OpsLog alert and workflow halt.

---

## 4. Operator-in-Loop Requirements

4.1 **Roles:**
* Chief Operator: final authority for baseline confirmations.
* Module Owner: responsible for module compliance.
* Audit AI: validates integrity, flags discrepancies.

4.2 **Procedures:**
* Explicit approval required for all human and machine file ingestion.
* Operator confirmation mandatory for project manifest SHA‑256 before downstream ingestion.
* Any deviation requires manual intervention; automation may not override human oversight.

---

## 5. Workflow Hierarchy & Execution Order

5.1 **Execution Order:**
* Modules processed sequentially 00 → 13 → 99.
* No module may proceed until the prior module is fully confirmed.

5.2 **Required Steps per Module:**
1. Human file ingestion & review.
2. Machine file generation & validation.
3. SHA‑256 hash computation & confirmation.
4. OpsLog append-only audit entry.
5. Operator confirmation to lock step.

5.3 **No Assumptions:**
* Premature closure, automated advancement, or skipped confirmations are strictly prohibited.

---

## 6. Rebuild, Packaging, and Synthesis Policies

6.1 **Rebuild Workflow:**
* Verbatim compilation of all human and machine files.
* Scope: entire project hierarchy.
* Locks canonical baseline upon operator confirmation.

6.2 **Packaging Workflow:**
* Only triggered by explicit request.
* Uses confirmed canonical baseline; produces ZIP archive with validation.
* No addition of new content.

6.3 **Synthesis Workflow:**
* Additive updates only.
* Requires explicit operator confirmation and audit logging.
* New baseline locked only after successful SHA‑256 verification.

---

## 7. File Naming, Prefixing & Folder Structure

7.1 **Module Naming:** `XX_ModuleName/` (2-digit padded index)

7.2 **Subfolders:** functional, descriptive.

7.3 **Human Files:** clear, descriptive; versioning maintained via Git and archival snapshots.

7.4 **Machine Files:** mirror human file structure; `.gitignore` prevents temporary, compiled, or log files from polluting repository.

7.5 **Prefix Rules:** alphabetical (A_, B_, C_) for modules with >7 human files or >1 functional sub-domain; optional for machine files unless spanning sub-domains.

---

## 8. CI/CD & Automation Standards

8.1 **Pipeline Requirements:**
* Validate SHA‑256, file presence, and structure.
* Halt automation if drift detected.
* Operator must resolve flagged issues.

8.2 **Machine Files & Artifacts:**
* Include `.gitignore`, `registry.json`, `audit_log.json`, module `manifest.json`.
* Automated parity checks across modules.

---

## 9. Integrity, Escalation & Exception Handling

9.1 **Drift Detection:**
* Minor drift: flag in OpsLog, operator notified.
* Critical drift: content mismatch, truncation, paraphrasing; immediate workflow halt.

9.2 **Rollback Procedures:**
* Revert to last confirmed canonical baseline.
* Audit logs retained; operator confirms rollback action.

---
