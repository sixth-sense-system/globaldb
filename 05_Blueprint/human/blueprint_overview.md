# Module 05: Blueprint Overview

## Purpose
Module 05 defines the **structural architecture, roadmap, sprints, tasking, and integration design** of ENERQIS.   
It translates **vision into structure**, ensuring enterprise-level clarity in design, milestones, and execution.

## Role within ENERQIS
- Provides the **master framework** for development sequencing.
- Anchors all technical and strategic work to a **cohesive design**.
- Ensures **consistency** across modules (Data, AI/Algo, Infra, Market, Theory, Research, Future).

## Core Functions
1. **High-Level Architecture** → Defining system layers, flow, and dependencies.
2. **Roadmap Definition** → Multi-stage development with milestones and goals.
3. **Integration Protocols** → Ensuring interoperability between modules.
4. **Execution Blueprint** → Day-to-day tasking and reminders (see roadmap_blueprint.md).

## Philosophy
- *Clarity over clutter*: High-level design, minimum complexity, maximum efficiency.
- *Iterative growth*: Roadmaps are staged, milestones compound over time.
- *Enterprise standard*: All documentation, processes, and designs reflect the highest professional rigor.

The Blueprint is living architecture: updated with every confirmed canonical baseline.
