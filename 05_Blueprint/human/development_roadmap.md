# ENERQIS — Development Roadmap (Merged Architecture & Stages)

## Purpose
This single canonical file contains ENERQIS layered architecture (concept → implementation) and the full **Stages, Milestones & Stage-Level Workflows**, including detailed deliverables and responsibilities. It is the authoritative reference for what to build, when, and why.

---

## ✦ Stages, Milestones & Stage-Level Workflows

> *Note:* these workflows are the authoritative operational steps per stage. Each workflow shows core tasks and who owns them (R = Responsible, A = Approver, C = Consulted, I = Informed).

---

### Stage 1 — Foundation & Live cBots (0–3 months)

**Phase 1.1 — Baseline Build**
1. Establish Global Database (folder structure, human + machine mirroring)
2. Repo & Governance (R: DevOps, A: Master Control)
   - Create repo skeleton, branch model, CODEOWNERS, policies, 'git' layout.
   - Configure branch protection rules (require PR reviews, status checks).
3. Secrets & Vault (R: Infrastructure, A: Governance)
   - Provision secrets vault (HashiCorp Vault or cloud KMS).
   - Create initial secret entries (broker test keys, db test creds).
   - Initial secrets policy, vault skeleton.
4. Environment & Dependencies (R: DevOps)
   - Create Conda/Python env spec, `requirements.txt`, `environment.yml`.
   - Pin core versions (python, pandas, pyarrow, etc).
5. Data Ingestion v1 (R: Data)
   - Implement `ingest.py` to pull sample historical files.
   - Validate with checksum and write into `raw/` and `processed/`.
   - Create `parquet/` baseline.
6. CI/CD & Packaging (R: DevOps)
   - Add unit tests, packaging job (mode: `package-only`), generate manifest.json.
- **Deliverable**: Canonical Global DB baseline repository (with human & machine files) + ingestion running locally.

**Phase 1.2 — Core cBots**
1. cBot Skeletons & Backtest Harness (R: Strategies)
   - Define strategies to move forward with (including "market energy" strats).
   - Create cBot templates with risk hooks & config manifests.
   - Run local backtests; store results with dataset + config hashes.
2. Log & Parity
   - Integrate logging and JSONL audit trails.
   - Local backtest harness and parity test scaffolding.
- **Deliverable**: Reproducible cBot prototypes with backtest reports and artifacts.

**Phase 1.3 — Ops & Deployment**
1. Monitoring & Ops (R: Ops)
   - Deploy minimal Grafana dashboards and alerting for ingestion latency, job failures, errors.
   - Validate packaging SOP end-to-end (package-only flow).
   - Paper-trading adapters integrated.
- **Deliverable**: Paper trading cycle + operational playbooks.

---

### Stage 2 — Algorithmic Evolution (3–9 months)

**Phase 2.1 — Python Parity**
- Create Python strategy skeletons (parity with cBot logic).
- Build a parity backtest harness (same inputs/outputs across platforms).
- **Deliverable**: Python parity prototypes.

**Phase 2.2 — Validation & Feature Store**
- Implement purged CV pipeline and walk-forward harness.
- Parameter-search automation (grid/SMBO skeleton).
- Feature Store & Experiment Tracking (Parquet feature store, dataset hashing, MLflow-like experiment tracking, metadata).
- **Deliverable**: Feature store + validated experiments with tracked artifacts.

**Phase 2.3 — Expansion**
- Multi-market Python strategies and parameter baselines.
- Add equities, futures, crypto connectors; expand normalization rules.
- Early portfolio-level aggregation logic.
- **Deliverable**: Diversified strategy set ready for sandbox experiments with reproducible experiment manifests.

---

### Stage 3 — AI Orchestration & Adaptation (9–24 months)

**Phase 3.1 — Meta-Models**
- Build embedding pipelines for news, features, and market snapshots.
- Strategy-selection meta-model training pipeline (supervised models, sandbox deployment).
- **Deliverable**: Ensemble selection prototypes.

**Phase 3.2 — Advisory AI**
- LLM ensemble advisor (grounding, provenance) + advisory layers.
- Agentic gating layer (explicit human approval for any auto-trade decision).
- **Deliverable**: Advisory system in sandbox + evaluation dashboards.

---

### Stage 4 — Productionization (24–36 months)
- Harden execution (latency SLAs, slippage model).
- Blue/green deployment templates, project runbooks.
- Risk automation: automated shutdowns, capital throttles.
- **Deliverable**: Live limited-capital deployments under governance.

---

### Stage 5 — Scale & Diversify (36+ months)
- Multi-asset pools and portfolio optimizer.
- Full governance board + compliance review cadence.
- **Deliverable**: Mature AI trading portfolio and governance.
