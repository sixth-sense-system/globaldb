# Module 05 — Module Integration Protocols

## Purpose
Defines **interconnections** between Module 05 (Blueprint) and all other ENERQIS modules.  
This ensures that design decisions are **system-wide**, not isolated.

---

## Integration Rules
1. **Single Source of Truth**  
   - Architecture, roadmap, and execution blueprints live in Module 05.  
   - Other modules may reference but not redefine these structures.  

2. **Dependency Mapping**  
   - Every task in Roadmap must explicitly map dependencies across:  
     - Data Layer  
     - AI/Algo  
     - Infra  
     - Market  
     - Theory  
     - Research  
     - Future  

3. **Canonical Sync**  
   - Each confirmed update in Module 05 propagates to all dependent modules via Packaging/Rebuild workflow.  

---

## Cross-Module Responsibilities
- **Data Layer** → Provides structured, normalized datasets into which Roadmap tasks feed.  
- **AI/Algo** → Consumes Roadmap direction for strategy building, backtesting, ML/AI evolution.  
- **Infra** → Implements CI/CD, vaults, monitoring, deployment standards.  
- **Market** → Supplies market-specific intelligence for Roadmap-driven experiments.  
- **Theory** → Anchors Roadmap tasks in conceptual models.  
- **Research** → Extends external knowledge into Roadmap.  
- **Future** → Captures unbuilt opportunities not yet staged in Roadmap.  

---

## Governance
- Integration changes must be reviewed by Governance Board before canonical confirmation.  
- Conflicts resolved at **Blueprint level**; downstream modules adjust accordingly.

---

## Notes
- Integration is a **dynamic process**; dependencies evolve.
- This document is updated whenever cross-module dependencies shift.
