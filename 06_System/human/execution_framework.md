# Execution Framework

## Purpose
Provides the architecture for how strategies are tested, validated, and executed consistently across environments. Ensures reproducibility, reliability, and alignment with defined system logic.

---

## Backtest Harness
Defines standardized protocols for simulation:
- Historical data normalization (adjustments for corporate actions, roll conventions for futures).
- Execution modeling (slippage, spreads, commissions).
- Out-of-sample and walk-forward testing integrated into workflows.
- Scenario analysis for stress conditions (liquidity shocks, volatility spikes).

---

## Parity Checks
Guarantee consistency across environments:
- Strategy logic verified between backtest and live.
- Data feed synchronization checks.
- Trade reconciliation between broker logs and internal records.
- Continuous monitoring for divergence.

---

## Experiment Tracking
Provides reproducibility and version control:
- Metadata stored for each run: parameters, environment, data slices, results.
- Hashing of input datasets for immutability.
- Linkage to strategy versioning (git/SVN).
- Automated logging of experiment lineage for auditability.

## Macro Drivers in Strategy Design
Strategies must reflect structural forces shaping asset classes.
Macro inputs such as **interest rate regimes, inflationary cycles, and monetary policy shifts** guide directional biases, volatility expectations, and portfolio allocations.

---

## Market Dynamics in System Logic
Market microstructure (order flow, liquidity pockets, volatility clustering) is integrated into rule design.
System triggers must align with observed dynamics like **trending vs. mean-reverting phases, liquidity shocks, and intraday volume distributions**.

---

## Behavioral Models in Trading Systems
Trader psychology and mass behavioral effects create predictable inefficiencies.
Anchoring bias, overreaction, and herding behavior manifest in price structure, forming exploitable strategy edges.
